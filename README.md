# Project-1

For each city listed in cities.csv, return all restaurants found via yelp api and
extract data regarding:

- name
- address & zip
- coordinates
- rating
- review count
- price level
- category
- yelp id


From above data, also determine the following for each city:

- total count of restaurants
- distribution of categories (eg. 10% Pizza, 20% Sushi, etc.)
- ratio of price level options (ie. total count of pricier levels divided by count of lower levels)
- total count of restaurants above a given rating
- concentration of restaurants (ie. total count divided by sq. mi of city)
